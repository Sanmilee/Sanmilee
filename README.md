#### I am a Machine Learning Engineer with 5+ years of experience in developing and deploying Machine Learning models. My current focus is on developing end-to-end ci/cd model pipeline using cutting edge tools like Vertex AI, Kubeflow and TFx.


#### When I am not deploying ML models in prod, I enjoy playing football or appreciating the adventurous world of astrophysics.
